# Accelerating-Drug-Development-with-D-MPNN-Predicting-ADME-Properties-for-Rapid-Discovery

**Introduction:**
ADME, a crucial property in drug discovery, has long been a challenge to predict accurately. Traditional methods rely on experimental determination, which is time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in machine learning offer a game-changing solution. Our project, 'ADME Prediction', harnesses the power of cutting-edge techniques like Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) and Directed Message Passing Neural Networks (DMPNN) to achieve unprecedented accuracy in ADME prediction. By leveraging these innovative methods, we aim to transform the drug discovery process, enabling faster and more efficient development of new treatments. Join us on this exciting journey to explore the potential of machine learning in revolutionizing ADME prediction!
